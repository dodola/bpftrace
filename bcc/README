BPF Compiler Collection (BCC)
github:https://github.com/iovisor/bcc
Toolkit for creating BPF based tracing tools.

Default version: https://github.com/michalgr/bcc/tree/compile-for-android

Building:
- cmake file does not correctly recognize linker flags and we need to tell
  the linker explictely where the directory containing libelf is
- cmake depends on flex binary, which needs to stay in sync with flex header
  and library we built for Android (using host flex won't work). We build
  flex for host from the same sources as we do for android and we override
  the binary used by cmake with -DFLEX_EXECUTABLE
