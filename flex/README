flex
flex is the fast lexical analyzer generator: https://github.com/westes/flex

Default version: v2.6.4
This is the most recent release up to date.
https://github.com/westes/flex/files/981163/flex-2.6.4.tar.gz

Building
flex is packaged with autoconf and builds without major problems. The only catch
is that I could not get checked in configure scripts to work so autoreconf is
required.
