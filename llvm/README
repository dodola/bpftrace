LLVM and Clang sources.
github: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project

Default version: v7.0.1
Latest stable release.

Building:
LLVM uses cmake and builds without major surprises. The only twist is that we
need host versions of llvm-tblgen and clang-tblgen which are not part of llvm
distribution so we need to build them on our own.
